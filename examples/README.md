## How it works

```
Agent → BrowseAI Dev → Internet / Enterprise Data → Verified answers + sources
```

BrowseAI Dev is **research infrastructure for AI agents** — every answer comes with real sources, confidence scores, and verified claims. Works with internet search out of the box, or plug in enterprise data sources (Elasticsearch, Confluence, custom endpoints).
