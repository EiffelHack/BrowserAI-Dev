## THE MOAT (Why We Win)

No competitor does what we do. Verified across all 8 major competitors:

| Capability | BrowseAI Dev | Perplexity | Tavily | Exa | Google Vertex | Everyone Else |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claim Verification (BM25+NLI) | YES | No | No | No | Partial | No |
| Evidence-Based Confidence | YES (7-factor) | No | No | No | Regressing | No |
| Cross-Source Consensus | YES | No | No | No | No | No |
| Contradiction Detection | YES | No | No | No | No | No |
| Atomic Claim Decomposition | YES | No | No | No | No | No |
| Domain Authority (10K+ Bayesian) | YES | No | No | No | No | No |
| MCP Server | YES | Moving away | Yes | Yes | No | Varies |
| Open Source (MIT) | YES | No | No | No | No | No |

**One-liner positioning options:**
- "The search API that fact-checks itself"
- "Tavily gives you search results. BrowseAI Dev tells you which ones are true."
- "AI agents hallucinate facts. BrowseAI Dev verifies them."

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (This Week)

### 1A. Fix UI Responsiveness (1 day)

15 concrete issues found across 5 pages. Fix patterns:

**Playground.tsx:**
- Line 341: Dropdown `sm:w-[500px]` overflows on mobile → add `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]`
- Line 412: Example pills `max-w-[280px]` truncates too aggressively → `max-w-[180px] sm:max-w-[280px]`
- Lines 672/744: Code blocks `p-4` → `px-2 sm:px-4`

**Dashboard.tsx:**
- Line 211: `max-h-96` too tall on mobile → `max-h-64 sm:max-h-96`

**Results.tsx:**
- Line 136: Query text `max-w-md` wider than mobile viewport → `max-w-[120px] sm:max-w-xs md:max-w-md`
- Line 143: Container `px-6` → `px-4 sm:px-6`

**Docs.tsx:**
- Line 107: Flex layout `gap-10` wastes space below lg → `gap-0 lg:gap-10` + `flex-col lg:flex-row`
- Lines 459/509/572: Tables need visual scroll indicator on mobile
- Line 878: Footer nav `gap-6` → `gap-2 sm:gap-4 md:gap-6`

**Sessions.tsx:**
- Line 366: Input `pr-32` (128px right padding) → `pr-20 sm:pr-32`
- Line 442: Pipeline steps → `hidden sm:inline` for trace details on mobile

**Components:**
- EvidenceGraph.tsx line 128: Domain names need `truncate max-w-[150px] sm:max-w-none`
- TracePipeline.tsx line 31: `max-w-[200px]` → `max-w-[100px] sm:max-w-[200px]`
- StreamingPipeline.tsx line 326: `max-w-md` → `max-w-xs sm:max-w-md`

### 1B. Build `langchain-browseaidev` Package (2 days)

**This is the #1 highest-leverage distribution move.** Tavily got to 1M monthly downloads through LangChain integration alone.

Build a Python package `langchain-browseaidev` that wraps BrowseAI Dev API as LangChain Tools:
- `BrowseAIDevSearchTool` — maps to `browse_search`
- `BrowseAIDevAnswerTool` — maps to `browse_answer` (verified search)
- `BrowseAIDevExtractTool` — maps to `browse_extract`
- `BrowseAIDevCompareTool` — maps to `browse_compare`

Publish to PyPI. Submit to LangChain integrations page. Write example notebook.

### 1C. MCP Registry Listings (2 hours)

Get listed on all three critical registries:
1. **Official MCP Registry** (registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) — submit via publisher CLI
2. **awesome-mcp-servers** (79.6k GitHub stars) — submit via glama.ai then PR
3. **Docker MCP Catalog** — PR to github.com/docker/mcp-registry

---

## PHASE 2: BENCHMARKS (1 week)

### Primary Target: AVeriTeC

**Why:** Real-world claims, open-web evidence retrieval, maps 1:1 to our pipeline. Current SOTA is only 63%. Active shared task at FEVER Workshop (EMNLP).

**Our pipeline alignment:**
- AVeriTeC requires: retrieve web evidence → verify claims → classify (Supported/Refuted/NEI/Conflicting)
- BrowseAI Dev does: web search → BM25 sentence retrieval → NLI classification → consensus → confidence
- Our NLI model (DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli) was literally trained on FEVER+ANLI

**Adaptation needed:**
- Download AVeriTeC dataset (4,568 claims from 50+ fact-checking orgs)
- Map our confidence scores to AVeriTeC's 4-way labels
- Evaluate using AVeriTeC's Ev2R recall metric
- Build eval harness: `scripts/benchmark/averitec.ts`

**Score targets:**
| Score | What it means |
|---|---|
| 40-50% | Average, not publishable alone |
| 55-62% | Publishable at workshop |
| >63% | New SOTA — publishable at top venue |

### Secondary Targets

**CLIMATE-FEVER** (1,535 real climate claims, SOTA ~72% F1):
- Socially important domain, strong narrative
- Needs Wikipedia corpus retrieval instead of web

**SciFact** (1,393 scientific claims, SOTA ~76% abstract F1):
- Demonstrates cross-domain generalization
- AllenAI benchmark with active leaderboard

### Deliverable

A `/benchmarks` page on browseai.dev showing:
- BrowseAI Dev scores on AVeriTeC, CLIMATE-FEVER, SciFact
- Side-by-side comparison: "Raw Tavily results" vs "BrowseAI Dev verified" on same claims
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for confidence scores — novel evaluation dimension

---

## PHASE 3: COMPARISON PAGE (3 days)

Build `browseai.dev/compare` showing side-by-side results:

### Head-to-Head Queries (50-100 factual questions)
Run the same queries through:
1. **BrowseAI Dev** (full pipeline with verification)
2. **Raw Tavily** (just search results, no verification)
3. **Perplexity API** (generated answer with citations)

Measure:
- **Factual accuracy** — manually verify 100 answers against ground truth
- **Citation quality** — do cited sources actually support the claims?
- **Confidence calibration** — are confidence scores meaningful?
- **Contradiction detection** — does the system flag conflicting info?

### Comparison Table (static, on the page)

| Feature | BrowseAI Dev | Tavily | Perplexity | Exa | Brave |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Price/1K queries | Free (100/day) | $8 | ~$1-15/M tokens | $5-15 | $5 |
| Claim verification | BM25+NLI hybrid | No | No | No | No |
| Confidence scores | 7-factor evidence-based | No | No | No | No |
| Consensus scoring | Cross-source | No | No | No | No |
| Contradiction detection | NLI-based | No | No | No | No |
| MCP server | 12 tools | 4 tools | Moving away | 3 tools | 6 tools |
| Python SDK | Yes | Yes | No native | Yes | No |
| Open source | MIT | No | No | No | No |
| Deep research mode | Yes (iterative) | No | No | Yes ($12/1K) | No |
